# R tint on Bigboards
===============================


This repository contains the necessary files for setting up a Hadoop, Spark, Rstudio & Shiny containerized application up and running on a [Bigboard](www.bigboards.io).

No prior knowledge of containers or Docker is necessary, but it assumed that your cluster is linked to the Hive http://docs.bigboards.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/. 

## Load existing tint


## Customize your own tint

### bb-stack-spark-on-hadoop-master

### docker-Application1-master & docker-Application2-master



Step0: Check bigboards existing containers 
The bigboards contai ners are also hosted there. You can choose one of these docker containers to use inside your app https://hub.docker.com/u/bigboards/, https://github.com/bigboards?page=5 or you can continue reading on how to create your own. And see the structure. Should have a folder named "R" containing the dockerfile and a folder named config containing the configuration file.
