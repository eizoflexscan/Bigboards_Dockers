
<p> At the end of each model, a Z-score is applied. 
Although they have been center to 0 and scale to 1, they can't easily be compared or aggregated into a global score.  
So far, we have therefore decided to take the max value as a global score. 
Later, we will extend the global score to take into account the complementary in models. 
Applied togheter can give better results than single models on their own.
