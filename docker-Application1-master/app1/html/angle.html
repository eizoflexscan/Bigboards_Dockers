<h5>General Idea </h5>
<p>
Angle-based Outlier Degree (ABOD) approaches are Global approach to outlier detection. It examines the spectrum of pairwise angles between a given point and all other
points. Outliers are points that have a spectrum featuring high fluctuation. In other words, 

<ul>
<li> Point p is an outlier if most other objects are located in similar directions (i.e. small ABOD) </li>
<li> Point p is no outlier if many other objects are located in varying directions (i.e. High ABOD)</li>

The algorithm in our case performs the basic and aprroximated version of angle-based outlier detection algorithm.
The ABOD method is especially useful for high-dimensional data, as angle is a more robust
measure than distance in high-dimensional space. The basic version calculate the angle variance
based on the whole data. The results obtained are more reliable. However, the speed can be very
slow. The approximated version calculate the angle variance based on a subset of data and thereby,
increasing the calculation speed. This function is based on the work of Krigel, H.P., Schubert, M.,
Zimek, A., Angle-based outlier detection in high dimensional data, 2008.

<h5> Advantage </h5>

<p>
Angles are more stable than distances in high dimensional spaces (cf.e.g. the popularity of cosine-based similarity measures for text data)

<h5> Assumptions </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Outliers are at the border of the data distribution </li>
<li> Normal points are in the center of the data distribution </li>
</ul>
