<h5>General Idea </h5>

<p>The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm">Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS)</a> algorithm is a 
local density-based approach. It was presented by Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel and Jorg Sander.
Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN, but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density. 
</br>

The idea is that normal data objects have a dense neighbourhood, 
while outliers are far apart from their neighbours, i.e. have a less dense neighbourhood. 
The algorithm therefore compares the density around a point with the density around its local reference (i.e. clusters of arbitrary shape).
Anomalies  are a set of data points that are very different from the other data points (i.e. point not assign to any cluster), and thus outliers.

<h5> Advantages </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> No assumption on the number of normal mechanisms is made. </li>
<li>It finds clusters of arbitrary shape in large datasets. </li>
<li>It provides relevant clusters even if the dataset contains noise. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Model Limit </h5>

<p>
<ul>
<li> The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its neighbours. </li>
<li> The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its neighbours. </li>
<li> Accuracy of outlier detection depends on how good the clustering algorithm captures the structure of clusters (i.e. how reference set is chosen). </li>
<li> A set of many abnormal data objects that are similar to each other would be recognized as a cluster rather than as noise/outliers. </li>
<li> This guarantee is valuable to the extent that outliers should not impact the construction of the clusters which will keep their integrity. </li>                                    
</ul>
