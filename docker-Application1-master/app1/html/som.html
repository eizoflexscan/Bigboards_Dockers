<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map"> Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) </a> are an unsupervised data visualisation technique 
that can be used to visualise high-dimensional data sets in lower (typically 2)
dimensional representations, called a map.

A self-organizing map consists of components called nodes or neurons. Associated with each node are a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data vectors, 
and a position in the map space. 
The procedure for placing a vector from data space onto the map is to find the node with the closest (smallest distance metric) weight vector to the data space vector.



Be carefull, it requires clean, numeric data (binary is okey but not multi factor)
