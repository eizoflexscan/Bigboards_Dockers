<h5> General idea </h5>
<p>Local Outlier Factor is a k-NN algorithm based on the concept of density. If the proximity of an object considerably deviates from the proximity of other objects it is considered an outlier.  
In other words, the more isolated is a record,the higher is the likelihood it is originating from anomalies. 
Local Outlier Factor of point <italic> p</italic> is defined as the average ratio of local reachability distance of the k-NN neighbors 
(i.e. the reference set) of point p and local reachability distance of point p. 	
<ul> 
<li> If LOF is closed to 1 the point is in a cluster (region with homogeneous density around the point and its neighbors). </li>
<li> If LOF >> 1, the point is an outlier. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Model Limits </h5>
<p>
<ul> 
<li> In regions of low density, it may be hard to detect outliers </li>
<li> Choose a low value for k is often not appropriate </li>
<li> If clusters of different densities are not clearly separated, LOF will have problems </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Extensions</h5>
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Treat low density and isolation differently (cfr. Connectivity-based oultier factor COF) </li>
<li> Take the \epsilon-neighborhood instead of kNNs as reference set (cfr Local outlier correlation integral (LOCI))) </li>
</ul>
