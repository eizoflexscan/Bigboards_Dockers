<h5>General Idea </h5>
<p>
Angle-based Outlier Degree (ABOD) approaches are Global approach to outlier detection.  It examines the spectrum of pairwise angles between a given point and all other
points. Outliers are points that have a spectrum featuring high fluctuation. In other words, 

<ul>
<li> Point p is an outlier if most other objects are located in similar directions (i.e. small ABOD) </li>
<li> Point p is no outlier if many other objects are located in varying directions (i.e. High ABOD)</li>
</ul>

The ABOD method is especially useful for high-dimensional data, as angle is a more robust
measure than distance in high-dimensional space (cf.e.g. the popularity of cosine-based similarity measures for text data). 
</br>
The algorithm in our case performs the approximated version of angle-based outlier detection algorithm.
It calculate the angle variance based on a subset of data and thereby,
increasing the calculation speed. This function is based on the work of Krigel, H.P., Schubert, M.,
Zimek, A., Angle-based outlier detection in high dimensional data, 2008.

<h5> Assumptions </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Outliers are at the border of the data distribution </li>
<li> Normal points are in the center of the data distribution </li>
