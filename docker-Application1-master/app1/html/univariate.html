<h5> General idea </h5>

<p>
Global outlier approaches apply a model to represent normal data points â€“ Outliers are points that do not fit to that model. In the case of <it> Univariate data analysis </it>, 
it means that, given a certain kind of statistical distribution (e.g., Gaussian), outliers are points that have a low probability to be generated by the
overall distribution (e.g., deviate more than 3 times the standard deviation from the mean).
</br>		   
Deviations from the mean are plotted in a <it> control charts </it>. Those charts derive from data a center line,
an upper and a lower bound, highlighting as outliers all records out of those limits.

<h5> Assumptions </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Normal data objects follow a (known) distribution and occur in a high probability region of this model.</li>
<li> Outliers deviate strongly from this distribution. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Model Limits </h5>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Basic model assumes only one <italic> normal </italic> generating mechanism , but there is usually more than one generating mechanism underlying the normal data.</li> 
<li> Basic model assumes that outliers are rare observations, but there may be a large class of similar objects that are the outliers. </li>
<li> Outliers are also in the reference set and may falsify the results because mean and standard deviation are very sensitive to outliers. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Extension </h5>
<p> 
<ul>
<li> Depth-based approaches </li> 
<li> Deviation-based approaches </li>
</ul>
