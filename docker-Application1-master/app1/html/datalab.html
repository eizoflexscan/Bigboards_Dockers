<p style="color:black; text-align:left">
MC data lab is a rapid exploration and development environment 
where a data science team explores data, hypotheses, and quantitative methodologies 
to answer core business questions with advanced analytics.
It is all about failing fast & learning fast. 
In a scientific context, this means stating hypotheses and seeking to disprove them using quantitative analysis of real data in rapid cycles. 
The end result is actionable insight and maximized value for business. 
</br>
In the data lab, a huge number of visualizations and statistical tests are typically generated 
to understand the nature and quality of the data sets and the relative merits of different statistical methods. 
R and Python are our go-to languages for this stage of data exploration, 
thanks to the huge number of actively supported statistics libraries and the relative brevity of data analysis scripts.
