<h5>General Idea </h5>

<p>The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm">Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)</a> algorithm is a local density-based approach. The idea is that normal data objects have a dense neighbourhood, 
while outliers are far apart from their neighbours, i.e. have a less dense neighbourhood. The algorithm therefore compares the density around a point with the density around its local
The reference contains a (small) subset of data objects (i.e. clusters of arbitrary shape).
It examines the spatial proximity of each object in the data space – If the proximity of an object considerably deviates from the proximity of other objects it is considered an outlier.  
The noise is a set of data points that are very different from the other data points (i.e. point not assign to any cluster), and thus outliers.
This guarantee is valuable to the extent that outliers should not impact the construction of the clusters which will keep their integrity.                                        


Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) is an algorithm for finding density-based clusters in spatial data. It was presented by Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel and Jörg Sander.[1] Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN,[2] but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density. In order to do so, the points of the database are (linearly) ordered such that points which are spatially closest become neighbors in the ordering. Additionally, a special distance is stored for each point that represents the density that needs to be accepted for a cluster in order to have both points belong to the same cluster.

<h5> Advantage </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li> No assumption on the number of normal mechanisms is made. </li>
<li>It finds clusters of arbitrary shape in large datasets. </li>
<li>It provides relevant clusters even if the dataset contains noise. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5> Model Limit </h5>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its neighbours. </li>
<li> The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its neighbours. </li>
<li>Accuracy of outlier detection depends on how good the clustering algorithm captures the structure of clusters (i.e. how reference set is chosen). </li>
<li>A set of many abnormal data objects that are similar to each other would be recognized as a cluster rather than as noise/outliers. </li>
</ul>
