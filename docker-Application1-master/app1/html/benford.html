
<h4> Benford's Law </h4>
<p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law'>Benford's law</a> tests the data against a theorical distribution of first digits, 
                     highlighting those records that significantly deviates from that distribution. This test has proven to be effective for the most
                     different kinds of anomaly detection, from tax frauds to social network suspicious behaviour. Generally speaking, Benford's
                     law is really good at looking for manipulation on datasets as a whoole.
                     
                     If they do not, then the numbers may be being influenced by something, such as manual manipulation.
