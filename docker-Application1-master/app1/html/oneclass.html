<p>
In machine learning, one-class classification, also known as unary classification, tries to identify objects of a specific class amongst all objects, by learning from a training set containing only the objects of that class. 
This is different from and more difficult than the traditional classification problem, which tries to distinguish between two or more classes with the training set containing objects from all the classes. 
The term One-class classification was coined by Moya & Hush (1996)[2] and many applications can be found in scientific literature, for example outlier detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection.
